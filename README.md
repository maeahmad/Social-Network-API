# Social Network API ðŸ’¬
As a Fullstack Web Developer, I developed an API for a social network that uses NoSQL database to handle large amounts of unstructured data.

# About
- As I invoke the application, Mangoose models are synced to Mango Database. 
- When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, then the data for each of these routes is displayed. 
- When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia for user and thoughts, then information can be created, updated, and deleted from the database.  
- Additionally API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia can create and delete reactions to thoughts and controle friends.
